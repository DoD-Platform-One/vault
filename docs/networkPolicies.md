Vault (like many other BigBang components) allows you to specify additional network controls through values provided to the chart.

In order to deliver additional NetworkPolicy controls with your BigBang Vault deployment, first enable networkPolicies for BigBang generally:

```
networkPolicies:
  enabled: true
```

Now you can add additional NetworkPolicies to your Vault addon configuration through the `addons.vault.values.networkPolicies.additionalPolicies` key:

```
addons:
  vault:
    values:
      networkPolicies:
        additionalPolicies:
        - name: this-is-an-egress-control
          spec:
            podSelector: {}
            policyTypes:
            - Egress
            egress:
            - to:
              - ipBlock:
                  cidr: 172.20.0.0/12
        - name: this-is-an-ingress-control
          spec:
            podSelector: {}
            policyTypes:
            - Ingress
            ingress:
            - from:
              - ipBlock:
                  cidr: 172.20.0.0/12
```
