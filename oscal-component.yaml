          # Control Summary
          Uniquely identify and authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined system services and applications] before establishing communications with devices, users, or other services or applications.

          # How does vault help?
          HashiCorp Vault is a secrets management solution that programmatically brokers access to systems for both humans and machines. It also provides granular access controls to SSH certificate parameters and signing, which is enforced by Vault policies.

          # Control Summary
          Issue public key certificates under an [Assignment: organization-defined certificate policy] or obtain public key certificates from an approved service provider

          # How does vault help?
          The PKI secrets engine generates dynamic X.509 certificates. With this secrets engine, services can get certificates without going through the usual manual process of generating a private key and CSR, submitting to a CA, and waiting for a verification and signing process to complete. Vault's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms provide the verification functionality.

          Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the following information at rest on [Assignment: organization-defined system components or media]: [Assignment: organization-defined information].

          # How does vault help?
          Vault encrypts secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage.
